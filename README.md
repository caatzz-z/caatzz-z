hii, i’m **𝐤𝐞𝐢 ₊˚⊹** , she/her <br>
i’m a self-taught coder who loves turning random ideas into working projects ✦  
i mostly code for fun — experimenting, learning, and seeing what i can make next.

i started coding on **7/27/25**, mostly exploring small projects and mini-games.  
currently, i’m focused on **web experiments** and creating small, fun projects.  
i don't have a favorite project so far — i love my projects all equally ૮ ․ ․ ྀིა
